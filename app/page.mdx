# Muh Supri

Hi I'm Muhammad Supri, a full-stack developer, but mostly managing the frontend.

I'm currently developing pationgi.com as a side project and weekend hobby. In addition, I also often write some tips or education about web developers on this website, you can visit [blogs](/posts) to read it.

That's all as a welcome, hopefully you can learn something from this website.
